# disease-detection
the focus of this project, which is development of an integrated multi-sensor system that combines RGB, temperature, and humidity sensors. This system aims to continuously monitor potato leaves and the surrounding environment, allowing for early detection of diseases and timely interventions. First, RGB Sensor: This sensor will analyze leaf color and pigmentation. Changes in leaf color can indicate disease presence before visible symptoms appear. Second, DHT-22, sensor which measures temperature and humidity. Temperature influences the metabolic processes of the potato plants and high levels of humidity or moisture cause rot in potato leaves. So, by monitoring these changes, farmers can take actions. The design requirement is detecting humidity and temperature using DHT22 and recognizing the plant color depending on color frequency using RGB color sensor.
